2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (like VS Code or IntelliJ)
3. Run the `Main.java` file after compiling

##  Notes
- This is a beginner-level project built while learning Java + DSA.
- OOP concepts like classes, encapsulation, and object interaction are applied.
- Currently console-based; GUI can be added in the future.

##  Future Improvements
- Add GUI using JavaFX or Swing
- Add login system
- Add fine calculation for late returns
